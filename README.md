# Operating-Platforms

The Gaming Room was my client, and they asked me to help expand their Android-only game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based, multi-platform application. Their main goals were to ensure the game could run on different operating systems and still support key features like unique team names, multiple players per team, and just one active game instance at a time. I was responsible for designing a software solution that met these needs. One thing I think I did particularly well was organizing and documenting each phase of the design process—clearly laying out the system requirements, evaluating platforms, and making strategic recommendations. Working through the design document really helped me think through the technical details and how everything would come together to support the game’s functionality.

What I found most helpful about creating the design document was how it pushed me to consider the user’s needs from the very beginning. It gave structure to my planning and made it easier to develop a solution that was not only technically sound but also user-friendly. If I had to go back and revise one part, I would improve the domain model section. I’d like to include more detail about how the Game, Team, and Player classes interact, and maybe even add diagrams to make those relationships clearer. I interpreted the user’s needs by studying how the existing game worked and thinking about how to make it more accessible and intuitive for different platforms. It’s incredibly important to focus on user needs during software design because it ensures that the final product is actually enjoyable and easy to use. Going forward, I’d use the same structured approach—starting with user requirements and system analysis—and I’d also include more user feedback during the development phase to make the application even stronger.
